# Assignment 1

This program reads in a csv file with information about employees that is not standardized or in the right format. It then goes through the file, extracting the data and modifying it so that it is all in the correct format. It does this by creating objects for each person and plugging in the modified data. If the file has incorrect data, the program tells the user, gives them the correct format and asks them to input the data again. Once all the data has been stored into a dictionary of Person objects (with each object carrying the data for one person), that dictionary is stored in a pickle file and then the user's updated and standardized information is outputted. 

This program can be run by providing a filename in the system arguments in the following format:

python3 cs4395_a1_hbm170002.py \<filename\>

I think one of the major strengths that Python has in text processing is the ease in which data can be manipulated. Since the text is in string format, python becomes very beneficial to use because it has a ton of built-in methods for string handling. Furthermore, due to the simplicity in its syntax, it is very easy to write clean and understable code in Python. 
However, in order to provide this simplicity to its users, Python uses a lot of memory and because it is  dynamically  typed, it has to execute code line by line. This leads to slower speeds and a lack of memory optimization. 

I have always enjoyed Python but I hadn't really used it in a while. This assignment really helped me remember the syntax that Python uses. I had to do alot of Googling to remember how to write functions, classes, etc but I eventually found my groove and remembered how much easier the syntax is compared to other languages.

# Assignment 3

This assignment creates a guessing game for users by choosing random processed words from a given file. The user gets a score of 5 assigned to them and that score increases by 1 if they guess a letter that was in the word and decreases by 1 if they guess an incorrect letter. If they guess the whole word correctly, they are congratulated and proceed to a new word. If, before they have guessed the word, their score becomes 0, the lose and the game ends. If the user wants to quit, they can enter '!'.
